## About the Project 🔍
In this project it was necessary to develop a *responsive WEB* system, where it is possible to register and log in to the website to follow the main news of the major championships in the world of E-Sports. 

The studies with this project started on <ins>**09/24/2020**</ins> and ended on <ins>**01/19/2021**</ins>.

## Development Process 📈
This project was divided into a few sprints to be able to organize it properly throughout the development process.

There will be a total of 3 development sprints:


* _**SPRINT 1 - <ins>UX/UI**_</ins> 🎨<br>
Sprint responsible for the development of all interfaces of the layout of **E-Players**, both for the *user experience*, and to be able to adapt to the needs of the system (in the BACK-END). This process is very important for the client to know what the "face" of the site will really look like, so it will be necessary to deliver a *WireFrame* (or **Low fidelity layout**) and a **High fidelity layout**, of which they must be within the *usability requirements* and with their due *functions* which are specified by the customer.


* _**SPRINT 2 - <ins>BACK-END**_</ins> 🔙<br>
Sprint responsible for the development of the entire structure behind the application, where **C#** was used as the *main language* for this project which also had other technologies and resources for its development, such as: **.NET Core** (or .NET, currently), **CSV files** (to store the data of registered users), **MVC** (software design, in which it was used to divide the logic of the program into 3 parts, Model-View-Controller) and among others *Frameworks* and *Models*.


* _**SPRINT 3 - <ins>FRONT-END**_</ins> 📰<br>
Sprint responsible for the development of the **WEB** project interface, which will be developed through **HTML** and **CSS**, with small participation of **JavaScript**. In this process, **responsiveness** was also made, which prepares the site to be viewed on *any type of screen*.

## Technologies Used 🤖
Here are all the technologies (both programs used, as well as methods and good practices) that have been used and applied throughout the project process.

* _**TIME MANAGEMENT**_ ⏱️
  * **<ins>Trello**</ins> : Program used for organizing tasks.

<br>

* _**UI/UX**_ 🎨
  * **<ins>Figma**</ins> : Program used to create high and low fidelity layouts.

<br>

* _**BACK-END**_ 🔙
  * **<ins>Scrum Methodology**</ins> : Methodology used to separate tasks into scopes (sprints), such as UX/UI, BACK-END and FRONT-END;
  * **<ins>PascalCase & camelCase**</ins> : Good practices used to visually organize the code better;
  * **<ins>C# Language**</ins> : Main programming language used in the project's BACK-END;
  * **<ins>.NET**</ins> : Platform framework that offered a standard library, a compiler and a "virtual machine" for the development of the entire project;
  * **<ins>CSV Files**</ins> : Text file that managed to store the information of registered users in tables as an Excel and, when one of these information was necessary, it would be easily retrieved from the CSV;
  * **<ins>MVC**</ins> : Software architecture that was used to separate concepts into 3 interconnected layers, the Model-View-Controller.

<br>

* _**FRONT-END**_ 📰
  * **<ins>HTML5**</ins> : Markup language used to develop the structures of the project pages;
  * **<ins>CSS3**</ins> : "Cascading Style sheet" that was used to give appearance to the structures of the project pages;
  * **<ins>JavaScript**</ins> : Programming language used to upgrade the visual presentation of project pages.
